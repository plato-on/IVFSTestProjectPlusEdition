Hi! This is another version of trying to realise C++ like virtual file system.
I got another idea of realisation before deadline. There is one interface method, which is not meant in the task, but seems like that could work.
To share ideas of how can it be realised another way.

Check.java is not updated!
Nothing works! 
It's just not to forget the idea.
