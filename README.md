# IVFSTestProjectPlusEdition
Hi! This is another version of trying to realise C++ like virtual file system.
I got another idea of realisation before deadline. There is one interface method, which is not meant in the task, but seems like that could work.
So this is not really working project, but is enough to share ideas of how can it be realised another way.

Check.java is not updated!
